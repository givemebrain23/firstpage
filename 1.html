<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>What is HTML?
To understand "HTML" from front to back, let's look at each word that makes up the abbreviation:

Hypertext: text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items

Markup: a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format

Language: a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands.

HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive. So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.

In this case, I like to break down the three technologies – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – this way: they are like a human body.</p>
